When the application is initialized a series of prompted questions will guide the user through the process. After completing the first entry for project manager, the prompts will guide the user to add other team members and will continue to ask until the user stops the process, ideally when all members have been added. In the end a page will be generated with all the team mebers information being presented in a card format for each member.
